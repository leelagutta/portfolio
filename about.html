 <article>
  <p>Even for 2001 it might sound naive, but back in india growing up in a tiny town, we were just catching up to the internet. 
  A fine Monday morning in my 7th grade computer Lab class. 
I was there trying to come up with the most innovative email Id. This was our class task for the day to create an email Id and send an email. I used to love writing letters to my friends and cousins and wait for their replies for days together. But now, the fact that you can send an email and it reached them with in sec and you no longer have to wait for ever was incredible. This was the moment I fell in love with technology</p>
<p>
Since then I grew up around technology. 
Making powerpoint presentations for everything
Sending too many e-greetings. Well I used to annoy people a tad bit too much (remember 123geetings.com? )
Endless hours making paintings on powerpoint.
Playing games until I managed to get a D</p>

<p>I wasn’t completely unaware of how these incredible products were build, but wanting to know more this industry it led me to engineering. 

Life gives us wonderful opportunities and its within us how much we make use of it.

My mom has a fashion design studio. It was then where I used to help her with the things in her studio led me to be more interested in the needs she was trying
to satisfy for her clients. 
Solving customer problems and satisfying there needs gave a great gratification. 
This is during this experience I learnt how its important it is to design things based on your consumer/customer.

There were things like
Price
time
Needs
Bodytype
Personality </p>

<p>Though I completely didn’t understand how my love for technology and love for designing might sense in Tech as I knew then. 

I decided to pursue design course in Academy of Art in San Francisco. 
Its in Sillicon Valley I got exposed to these amazing companies creating amazing products that people use everyday. 

Everything came together. Until then I was just thinking technology as technology, but I learnt technology is designed too, in the form of products we use everyday.
