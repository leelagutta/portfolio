// It was back in 2008, when my mom's small business needed marketing to take off. As we bootstratped it overselves, we had very little money to spend on marketing. Thats when facebook pages was introduced. 
// And It reached 1000's of people within days and suddenly everybody were talking about a business that was in a corner somewhere where its almost hard find. That was when I realised the power of technology. 
// The way it transfomred our business and infact our major marketing even till today is through social media. And 70% of new customers find us through facebook. 
// The fact it was soo easy to get a presence in social media and how it transformed our business changed the way I looked at technology. It further inspired me to be part of it and build something thats meaningful for the users.
